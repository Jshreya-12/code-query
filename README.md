# Automated Code Documentation Generation and Query Chatbot using RAG

## Overview

**Automated Code Documentation Generation and Query Chatbot** is an AI-powered system designed to **automatically generate code documentation** and provide **context-based code queries** using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Large Language Models (LLMs). This tool significantly reduces the manual effort involved in documentation and enhances productivity by 30%.

## Features

- **Automated Code Documentation**: Automatically generates detailed and accurate code documentation by extracting key components using Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs).
- **Context-Based Querying**: Uses RAG and LLMs to answer context-specific code queries, enabling a more intuitive way to interact with your codebase.
- **AST Integration**: Leverages ASTs to extract critical elements of the code, ensuring high-quality and relevant documentation.
- **30% Workflow Efficiency Boost**: Saves developers time by automating the documentation process and streamlining the process of retrieving code-related information.

## Benefits

- **Reduces Manual Effort**: No more manual documentation – let the AI take care of generating documentation for your codebase.
- **Improved Code Understanding**: Get precise, context-based answers to code queries, increasing clarity and understanding.
- **Boosts Productivity**: By automating repetitive tasks, developers can focus more on writing code and less on documenting it.

## How It Works

1. **Input**: The system analyzes your code and extracts key components using AST.
2. **Code Documentation Generation**: Using advanced AI algorithms, the system auto-generates comprehensive documentation for the code.
3. **Context-Based Querying**: With the help of RAG and LLMs, developers can query the documentation for context-specific answers to improve code comprehension.


## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: For context-based querying and AI-driven documentation generation.
- **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: For intelligent responses and accurate code understanding.
- **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)**: For code analysis and extraction of key components.
